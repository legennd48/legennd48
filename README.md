## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **passionate software engineer** with a strong background in backend development and a growing specialization in **cybersecurity**. I thrive on solving complex problems and building scalable, secure applications that deliver real value.

My tech journey began with education and problem-solving, but has evolved to embrace cloud-native systems, secure backend APIs, and AI-powered tools. Now, I’m on a mission to **combine backend engineering with cybersecurity** — and someday soon, AI — to create solutions that are efficient, secure, and transformative.
